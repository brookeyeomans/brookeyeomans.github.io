    <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
    <h4>Valencia in Eastern Spain is the undisputed home of paella. It is one of the largest natural ports in the <br>Mediterranean and has been one of the most important rice-producing areas in Spain since rice was<br> introduced by the Moors over 1200 years ago. Paella was also traditionally eaten with a group of people<br> straight from the pan in which it was cooked with each person using his own wooden spoon.</h4>

    <h3>By the Fire</h3>
    <h4>Paella was originally farmers’ and farm labourers’ food, cooked by the workers over a wooden fire for the <br>lunchtime meal. It was made with rice, plus whatever was on hand around the rice fields and countryside:<br> tomatoes, onions, and snails, with a few beans added for flavor and texture. Rabbit or duck might also<br> have been added, and for special occasions, chicken plus a touch of saffron for <br>an extra special color and flavor.</h4>
