        <p>They are of great quality and resistance, they can be used in gas, wood, and oven. There are models compatible with vitro, induction, and electric cooker (make sure before buying). A small difference is that stainless steel does not distribute the heat very well for cooking rice, so it is convenient to have a fire that evenly distributes the heat throughout the base. Under strong fire, they can deform.
        They do not require special maintenance and 
        cleaning is very easy.</p>
